Now  I will show you the correct steps to run the code.
**Step 1: Convert the code to the correct form.**  
We will first convert the TensorFlow code in `agent.py`, `training.py`, `game_environment.py`, and `game_visualization.py` to PyTorch.
**Step 2: Create environment.**
Run obstacles_board_generator.py to generate obstacles and create the training environment for the model.
**Step 3: deep learning.**
Step 3: Run the `supervised_training.py` program to lay the foundation for training and enable the model to perform deep learning.
**Step 4: start training.**
Step 4: Run `training.py` to train the model 200,000 times and generate the resulting training data.
**Step 5: find best model.**
Step 5: Inspect the data and identify the best-performing model.
**Step 6: save the image.**
Step 6: Generate data curves to verify that training proceeded correctly, and save the curve plots.
**Step 7: Evaluate the learning outcomes.**
Step7：Generate a GIF or MP4 to observe the snake's learning results.
